# 1. Project Introduction

## Project Overview
The project aims to develop a dynamic digital menu board that solves the problem of dietary requirements (such as allergies, vegan, diabetes) in restaurants and cafeterias. By integrating AI and IoT technologies, the system identifies customer needs and provides suitable dish recommendations while dynamically updating the menu based on real-time environment and dietary restrictions.

## Solution Overview
- **Camera Captures Dishes, Stored in Database**: A camera will recognize dishes and upload image data to a database, providing materials for the AI recommendation system.  
- **Microcontroller Records Customer Order Requests**: Customers can input their order requests via voice or buttons, which will be sent to the backend system to recommend appropriate dishes.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor Detects Customer Presence**: The ultrasonic sensor will detect customer proximity, automatically triggering menu display or recommendations when a customer approaches.  
- **RFID/NFC Sensor for Customer Identification**: RFID/NFC technology will be used to identify the customer’s identity, and based on their past orders, preferences, and dietary needs, the system will provide personalized dish recommendations.

# 2. Scope of the Project / List of Activities

This project aims to develop a dynamic intelligent menu system that integrates multiple sensors and AI technologies to provide personalized dish recommendations based on customers' dietary needs, preferences, and environment. The system utilizes RFID/NFC technology for customer identification, ultrasonic sensors to monitor customer arrival, cameras to capture and store dish images in a database, and microphone sensors to capture customer orders and intelligently recommend appropriate dishes. This system aims to improve restaurant operational efficiency and enhance the customer experience.

### Dish Recognition and Database Setup
- Integrate a camera system to capture dish images.  
- Store the captured dish images and associated metadata in a database for AI recognition and recommendation.  
- Ensure the database is updated in real time to facilitate the addition of new dishes.  

### Customer Order Processing
- Integrate a microcontroller to capture customer order requests, supporting voice commands or button input.  
- Send customer order data to the backend system for further processing.  

### Customer Arrival Detection System
- Design and implement an ultrasonic sensor to detect customer arrival.  
- Automatically trigger menu display or recommendation functions upon customer approach.  

### RFID/NFC Integration
- Integrate RFID/NFC sensors to identify returning customers.  
- Provide personalized menu recommendations based on customer order history, taste preferences, and dietary requirements.  

### Sensor Integration and Testing
- Integrate all sensors (camera, ultrasonic, microphone, RFID/NFC) into a unified system.  
- Test the entire system to ensure smooth interaction between sensors and the backend system.  

### User Interface Design and Interaction
- Design interactive user interfaces for customers and back-end systems.  
- Ensure a user-friendly interface and smooth communication between customers and the system.  

### System Debugging and Optimization
- Perform system debugging, testing, and optimization to ensure optimal system performance.  
- Adjust system configuration based on test results to ensure real-time responsiveness.  

### Documentation and Reporting
- Prepare technical documentation and reports.  
- Record all meeting content, project progress, and challenges encountered.
